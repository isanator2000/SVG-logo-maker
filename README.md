# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This Node.js command-line application takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.

## How to use     

To run this application, use the command line to navigate to the directory of the application. Install all dependencies (npm i) and then type the command node index.js. A series of questions will appear. Once they've all been answered properly, a message will display to the command line telling you your logo has been made. You can find it in the newly generated SVG file.
